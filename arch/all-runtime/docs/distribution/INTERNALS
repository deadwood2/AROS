=================================Introduction==================================

AxRuntime (AxRT) is a product for application developers who enjoy creating
their applications using Amiga APIs.

The runtime allows developers to continue developing Amiga applications in
unmodified way while at the same time being able to utilize modern development
tools available on Linux like IDEs, debuggers, profilers, etc.

This solution lets developers compile their Amiga API-based applications as
Linux binaries. Once the features are implemented, tested and optimized using
the runtime on Linux, developers re-compile their applications for their
Amiga-like system of choice and perform final quality checking.

Applications created with AxRuntime can be distributed to the Linux
community giving developers a much broader user base and a possibility to
invite developers from outside general Amiga community to contribute to the
application.

AxRuntime is based on work of AROS projects, which is an open source
re-implementation of AmigaOS 3.1 API. More information on AROS is available

===================================Internals===================================

1) How a shared module is structured?

    A shared module is a collection of functions that is accessing by making
    calls relative to modules "base". Examples of modules are libraries (
    dos.library), devices (timer.device), resources, etc.

    A shared module under AxRuntime is an ELF dynamic object (ET_DYN) (also
    called shared object) with a predefined interfaces. Such object needs to
    expose function called __get_resident which returns the Resident structure
    of a module.

    Functions calls of module are done in the same way as in Amiga, as a jump
    table (LVO) relative to modules base acquired for example from OpenLibrary
    call. Functions are not exposed via ELF mechanisms like GOT or PLT.

    Modules name retains Amiga naming, so DOS is named dos.library, not dos.so
    or dos.library.so.

    Modules are LoadSeg'ed using dlopen() calls.

2) How an executable is structured?

    A regular AxRuntime-enabled executable has so called "dual-run" capability.
    This means the same executable can be started directly from Linux console
    as well as directly from AxRuntime (RunCommand(), SystemTags() or Shell).

    To achieve this an executable needs to be loadable by Linux and this is
    achieved by making every executable a dynamic object, but with a defined
    entry point. Necessary configuration is provided in axrt.spec file which
    needs to be used during compilation and linking stages.

    When started from Linux, the sequence is the following:

    (startup.o) _axrt_start (Linux side entry point)
                    |
                   \ /
    (startup.o) __runtimestartup
                    |
                   \ /
    (startup.o) __kick_start (initializes runtime and calls AxRT-side entry)
                    |
                   \ /
    (startup.o) __startup_entry (AxRT side entry point)

    When loaded into existing, running runtime, only AxRT side entry
    (__startup_entry) is called directly from DOS.

    __startup_entry is the single function that needs to be exposed from an
    executable. Executables are LoadSeg'ed using dlopen() calls.
