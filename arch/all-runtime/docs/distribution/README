=================================Introduction==================================

AxRuntime (AxRT) is a tool for application developers who enjoy creating
their applications using Amiga APIs.

The runtime allows developers to continue developing Amiga applications in
unmodified way while at the same time being able to utilize modern development
tools available on Linux or Windows like IDEs, debuggers, profilers, etc.

This solution lets developers compile their Amiga API-based applications as
Linux binaries. Once the features are implemented, tested and optimized using
the runtime on Linux or Windows, developers re-compile their applications for
their Amiga-like system of choice and perform final quality checking.

Applications created with AxRuntime can be distributed to Linux or Windows
communities, giving developers a much broader user base and a possibility to
invite developers from outside general Amiga community to contribute to the
application.

================================Acknowledgement================================

AxRuntime is based on work of AROS projects, which is an open source
re-implementation of AmigaOS 3.1 API. More information on AROS is available

================================Using AxRuntime================================

1) What is available is current version?

    Current version is version V41.4

    This is an early preview version allowing application developers to test
    compilation and execution of their applications against the runtime. This
    version is mainly aimed at gathering feedback on directions in which
    runtime should evolve, however simple applications will already be fully
    supported and usable.

    Notes:
    - In case of issues, please make sure you have only one monitor connected
      to your Linux when running this preview.
    - This version was developed and tested under Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit.
      Compatibility with other Linux distributions may vary. Ubuntu-based
      distribution like Linux Mint are supported.

2) How do I install and use the runtime?

2.1) If you are a Linux user.

    Runtime is composed of three modules: libaxrt-4.0.so and AXRTSYS and
    USERSYS directories. Application loads libaxrt-4.0.so, which then in turn
    initializes the runtime and user settings.

    Runtime is distributed as .deb package which can be downloaded from
    https://axrt.org/index.php?tab=download. Package name is libaxrt-4.0. The
    package installs into /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/axrt/4.0

2.2) If you are a Windows user.

    AxRuntime is confirmed to work with Windows Subsystem for Linux feature of
    Windows 10 and 11. This feature allows running "a Linux" in a background
    and since AxRuntime binaries are Linux binaries, they can also use this
    feature to give impression of running nativelly under Windows.

    If you are running a fairly recent Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the
    following guide to install WSL2:

    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps

    If this does not work for you, you can still install a standalone X server
    following this guide, choosing option 1 - VcXsrv

3) How do I control the startup (a.k.a S/Startup-Sequence)?

    Startup of each application under AxRuntime is executed at and of chain of
    three startup scripts:

    AXRTSYS:S/Startup-Sequence - this script contains commands that are used
    globally for all applications. It is located in the runtime
    installation directory and should not be edited by users. All changes will
    be lost when installing new version of runtime.

    SYS:S/User-Startup - this script contains commands that can be
    customized by user. It is run for every application.

    PROGDIR:S/Package-Startup - this script contains commands which are
    specific to a single application being started. It needs to be located
    in subdirectory S of directory containing program executable.

4) What volumes and assigns are automatically created?

    ROOT: - volume mapping Linux root directory ("/")

    AXRTSYS: - assign mapping to system-wide portion of runtime files

    SYS: - assign mapping to location of user portion of runtime files

    HOME: - assign mapping to user home directory

    Additionally WORK: assign is mapped to HOME:Work. This can be changed
    by editing SYS:S/User-Startup

5) Known issues

    a) AxRuntime has problems operating with dual-screen setup - for example
    menu items cannot be clicked. For the time being use of single monitor or
    monitor closing (same display on both monitors) is required.
