This driver created by Neil Cafferkey and paid for by Peter Membrey and
Steve Jones (iMica, Checkmate). This is to allow all AROS fans to have
access to a fully supported NVidia powered beast of a computer at low cost.
We hope you purchase a complete system from us with this link to our sales
page for a complete setup but also the model of the motherboard and a link
to buy one, ASUS M2N68-AM SE2.
