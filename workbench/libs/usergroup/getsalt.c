    NAME
        ug_GetSalt - generate password encryption setting for an user

    SYNOPSIS
        setting = ug_GetSalt(passwd, buffer, size);
          D0                   A0      A1     D0

        UBYTE *ug_GetSalt(const struct passwd *, UBYTE *, ULONG);

    FUNCTION
        This function generates a setting parameter, which is used to
        configure the password encryption process.  If an old entry exists,
        the new salt depends on it.

        The particular salt format depends on the system security level.

    INPUTS
        passwd - the old passwd entry for the user, or NULL if there is none.

        buffer - address of character array, which the new salt is stored
                 in.

        size   - the number of bytes in the buffer. The buffer should be at
                 least 12 bytes long. 

    RETURN VALUE
        Pointer to the buffer, or NULL if the buffer is too small.

    NOTE
        By default the Version 7 UNIX compatible setting is generated.
