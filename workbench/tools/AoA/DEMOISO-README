*IMPORTANT*

This ISO contains prototype of emulator for running ABIv0 programs under 64-bit
AROS. At this point it is expected that only a few programs other than included
will even start. For programs that start, it is expected that only a few of
their functions will work.

Emulator is at this moment only a prototype. When emulator executes functions
that have not yet been made supported, it will crash and stop.

You have been warned.

1. Usage

From Shell type:

aoa <path-to-abiv0-program>

2. Dependecies

   Emulator will try to load ABIv0 libraries from SYSV0:Libs. By default, SYSV0:
   point to RAM:i386.

   ABIv0 programs included with emulator are localted in SYSV0:Programs.

   If the program requires additional 32-bit library, copy it from ABIv0 build
   to SYSV0:Libs. Other dependencies, like datatypes or Zune classes, also
   follow standard paths, but starting at SYSV0:

3. Known issues

- codesets.libary will crash emulator
- sound and network are not supported

4. ISO is missing InstallAROS. If you need persistance, add disk image to your
   VM and then use HDToolBox with following schema PC-MBR->RDB->DH0.
