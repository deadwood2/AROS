*IMPORTANT*

This is an early alpha version of prototype of emulator for running ABIv0
programs under 64-bit AROS. At this point it is expected that only a few
programs other than included will even start. For programs that start, it is
expected that only a few of their functions will work.

Emulator is at this moment only an early alpha version. When emulator executes
functions that have not yet been made supported, it will crash and stop.

EmuV0 v0.10

1. Usage

   There are two separate binaries, one for running under Linux-hosted AROS,
   (EmuV0-linux) other for running under native AROS(EmuV0-pc). Using
   Linux-hosted binary on native and vice versa will result in a crash.

   From Shell type:

   EmuV0-linux <path-to-abiv0-program>

   Notes:
    - it is not possible to pass argument to ABIv0 programs at this time

2. Dependecies

   Emulator will try to load ABIv0 libraries from LIBSV0:. If emulator is
   installed in default location, the Package-Startup script will take care
   of creating the needed assigns.

   ABIv0 programs included with emulator are localted in SYS:ProgramsV0. ABIv0
   programs can be placed anywhere on disk.

   If the program requires additional 32-bit library, copy it from ABIv0 build
   to LIBSV0. Other dependencies, like datatypes or Zune classes, also
   follow standard paths, but starting at EmuV0:

3. Known issues

   - codesets.libary will crash emulator
   - sound and network are not supported at this time
