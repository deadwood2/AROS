This is an emulator for running ABIv0 programs under 64-bit AROS. At this
point it is expected that above 80% of ABIv0 programs will start and exit
gracefully. For programs that start, it is expected that a large, useful
subset of their functions will work.

EmuV0 v1.0 (21.01.2026)

1. Usage

   There are two separate binaries, one for running under Linux-hosted AROS,
   (EmuV0-linux) other for running under native AROS(EmuV0-pc). Using
   Linux-hosted binary on native and vice versa will result in a crash.

   From Shell type:

   EmuV0-linux <path-to-abiv0-program> <abiv0-program-arguments>

2. Known issues

   - network, 3D, AppIcons and AREXX ports are not supported at this time

3. Dependecies

   Emulator will try to load ABIv0 libraries from LIBSV0:. If emulator is
   installed in default location, the Package-Startup script will take care
   of creating the needed assigns.

   ABIv0 programs can be placed anywhere on disk.

   If the program requires additional 32-bit library, copy it from ABIv0 build
   to LIBSV0. Other dependencies, like datatypes or Zune classes, also
   follow standard paths, but starting at EmuV0:

4. Unhandled code paths

   If EmuV0 executes a code path that is not fully implemented it will
   show a requester and suspend the emulated program. Make a screen shot of
   this requester and post it in EmuV0 thread on https://arosworld.org
   along with explanation what to do to replicate this scenario.
