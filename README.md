## AxRuntime

AxRuntime (AxRT) is a product for application developers who enjoy creating their applications using Amiga APIs.

The runtime allows developers to continue developing Amiga applications in unmodified way while at the same time being able to utilize modern development tools available on Linux like IDEs, debuggers, profilers, etc.

This solution lets developers compile their Amiga API-based applications as Linux binaries. Once the features are implemented, tested and optimized using the runtime on Linux, developers re-compile their applications for their Amiga-like system of choice and perform final quality checking.

Applications created with AxRuntime can be distributed to the Linux community giving developers a much broader user base and a possibility to invite developers from outside general Amiga community to contribute to the application.
