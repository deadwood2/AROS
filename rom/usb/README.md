Poseidon is the software solution that brings USB to the Amiga. It will run on every Amiga equipped with OS3.1 or higher.

Supported USB clases -:


 - hub.class for the root hub and external hubs. Allows real plug-and-play and unplugging of USB devices at the user's will (tested with an external hub and a composite keyboard-hub).
 - bootmouse.class for mice (lots of different mice tested).
 - bootkeyboard.class for keyboards (several keyboards tested).
 - printer.class delivering an usbparallel.device for printing (tested with Canon S400/S450/S500, Hewlett Packard printers)
 - massstorage.class for flash card readers and other mass media.


Trident, is the GUI/Prefs interface for Poseidon.

The whole stack and its class drivers can be made ROM resident, so that the USB mouse and keyboard is already available in the boot menu.
